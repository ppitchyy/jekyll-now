Day 2: Chichen Itza

The round trip to Chichen Itza from Cancun ended up taking the whole day. We decided to take public transportation early in the morning since it was the most reasonable option, and each leg took around 4 hours with a small stop in Valladolid (actually, it was literally a 15 minute break at a convenience store for food and toilet).

Chichen Itza is one of the new 7 wonders of the world. It is well known for the famous Temple of Kukulkan (or El Castillo). Interesting facts about the structure: it has 365 steps, one for each day of the year. There are four sides on the base of the pyramid structure where each side has 91 steps, and the final 365th step resides on the top. The temple indicates the Maya civilization, regarding astronomy, calendar, and architecture.

Regardless of the scorching heat, we had a lot of fun learning about Maya culture and doing a lot of sightseeing. There were limited options for food in the area though (either $$ or $$$$), so I would recommend eating before you visit or you would end up having tasteless fried chicken and fries with instant noodles like us. Additionally, we almost missed the bus back to Cancun since we had no idea we were in a different timezone! (Cancun is an hour faster)


Day 3: [Xcaret](http://www.xcaret.com/), Playa del Carmen

Coming here after the whole day burning ourselves alive at Chichen Itza was the best decision. I bought the tickets online in advance so we got some good discount. We spent the entire day here (literally 9AM to closing hours); enjoyed a bunch of activities this place had to offer:
    * Paddled a kayak through caves
    * Saw loads of enormous tortugas swimming right by our chilling spot
    * Swam in underground rivers
    * Snorkeled with fish
    * GREAT BUFFET! Ate over 40 huge shrimps dipped in cocktail and 7 slices of cake
    * Napped on a hammock (this had to happen after the buffet) which had a terrific panorama view of the Caribbean Sea
    * Watched exciting cultural performances
    * Went rope climbing on the beach
    * Drank lots of margaritas of course!
    * etc.

I wish I had taken more photos here, but I definitely enjoyed this place better without my phone.
