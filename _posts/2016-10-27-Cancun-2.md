We took a 4.5-hour bus ride to see one of the world's seven wonders, and almost missed the bus back since we weren't aware of the timezone difference...
On the next day, we took another 1.5-hour bus ride to one of the best eco-archaeological parks in Riviera Maya.


* Day 3: Xcaret (in Playa del Carmen)

* We spent the entire day here. Got lost in the forest. Paddled through some caves. Snorkeled with fishes. Ate over 40 huge shrimps dipped in cocktail and 7 different kinds of cake.
Saw enormes tortugas swimming in the pool right by us. Napped on a hammock, surrounded by panoramic view of the sea. Watched cultural performances and lit up candles with thousands of people.
Went on the same slider 15 times in 10 minutes. Tried rope climbing. Relaxed at a private beach. Sipped on legit margarita.  
I wish I've taken more photos here, but the water was irresistible :D
