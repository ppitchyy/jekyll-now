title: Cancun Adventures - Chichen Itza, Xcaret 
---

Took a 4.5-hour bus ride to see one of the world's seven wonders without being aware of the timezone difference and severe heat. 
Took another 1.5-hour ride the next day for a ton of fun in one of the best eco-archaeological park in Riviera Maya.

* Day 2: Chichen Itza

* We spent the entire day here. Got lost in the forest. Paddled through some caves. Snorkeled with fishes. Ate over 40 huge shrimps dipped in cocktail and 7 different kinds of cake. 
Saw enormes tortugas swimming in the pool right by us. Napped on a hammock with a panorama view of the sea. Watched cultural performances and lit candles with thousands of people.
Went on the same slider 15 times in 10 minutes. Tried rope climbing. Relaxed at a private beach. Sipped on legit margarita. SO WORTH IT - 10/10 would recommend!
I wish I've taken more photos here, but I couldn't resist leaving my phone in the locker and jumping right into the water.
