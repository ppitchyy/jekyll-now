Did I really spend three hours doing this

* Servings: 8 (assuming 1 roti/person)
* Ingredients
  - 2 cups of wheat flour (all-purpose flour is fine)
  - 1 (small) egg yolk
  - 1 tsp sugar
  - 1/4 tsp salt
  - 1/4 tbsp butter
  - 3/8 cups water
  - 1/4 cups milk
  - Vegetable oil for frying
  - Sweetened condensed milk for topping
  - Thai tea (simply boil Thai tea leaves, filter them out, and add sugar to the tea to your liking)

* Recipe:
1. Mix salt and sugar in 3/8 cups water and stir until dissolved.
2. Add flour to mixing bowl. Make a hole in the middle.
3. Pour the mixture from part 1 into the hole. Add egg yolk.
4. Slowly add water (little by little) and massage the flour mixture until smooth.
5. Melt the butter. Add to flour mixture and massage a bit more.
6. Divide the roti mixture into 8 small, spherical balls. Brush some vegetable oil on them and let them sit for an hour.
7. Brush some oil onto a large plate (or whatever you want to roll/shape the roti on).
8. Roll the roti onto the plate into a thin-layered, circular-shaped sheet.

9. Add oil to the pan and turn on medium-high heat.
10. Fry the roti. Fold the curves inwards to make a square. Flip when the pan-facing side turns light brown. Remove when the other side is also done.
11. Top the roti with some sugar, butter, and condensed milk. Now it's done :D
12. You can also cut it into squares like how they do it in Thailand, street-style.
13. Have it with Thai tea, or mix warm thai tea with condensed milk and pour onto roti.
