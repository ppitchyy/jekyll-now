Ochazuke is a simple Japanese dish that consists of steamed rice and savory ingredients (like salted grilled salmon, scallions, bubu arare, umeboshi) submerged in green tea or dashi soup.
Not only extremely easy and quick to make, but it is also warm and comforting to eat.

* Servings: 1
* Ingredients
  - 1/2 fillet of salmon
  - 1 cup cooked rice
  - 1/4 tsp roasted white sesame seeds
  - 2 strands of scallions (chopped into small pieces)
  - Nori seaweed for topping
  - Wasabi (optional)
  (For dashi/soup)
  - 1 cup dashi
  - 1 tsp mirin
  - 1 tsp Japanese soy sauce (I used Kikkoman)
  - 1/8 tsp salt

* Recipe:
1. Bake the salted salmon (seasoned for at least 10 min) at 380F degree for 30 min.
2. Remove the skin when cooked. Break up salmon into small pieces. Set aside.
3. Combine all ingredients for dashi and bring to boil.
4. Add cooked rice to a bowl. Place salmon pieces on the rice. Top with seaweed, scallions, and sesame seeds as desired.
5. Pour the dashi until it covers up to half of the rice. Have it with warm matcha (green tea) or hojicha tea :)
6. You can also use green tea or hojicha to substitute in for dashi.
