Back in the teenage days, I'd always been a bookworm. Needless to say, I barely had time to read throughout college, so it was one of my major goals to get back into reading once I start working... well, technically I graduated last year but my 2016 reading challenge was a flop since it was hard to make reading a habit again. So I pulled myself together and started easy with a goal of 30 books. It's not a lot, but I gotta start somewhere right? 🤷🏻📈 

* Goal: 30 books 🙂
* Read: 39 books 🙌
